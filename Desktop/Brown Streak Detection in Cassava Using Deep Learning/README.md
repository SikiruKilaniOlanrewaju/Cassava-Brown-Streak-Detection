# Brown Streak Detection in Cassava Using Deep Learning

This project uses Python and PyTorch for detecting brown streak disease in cassava. 

## Project Structure
- `data/` - Dataset and data processing scripts
- `notebooks/` - Jupyter notebooks for experiments
- `models/` - Saved models and model-related code
- `scripts/` - Training, evaluation, and utility scripts

## Setup
1. Create a virtual environment:
   ```powershell
   python -m venv .venv
   .venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```powershell
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Requirements
See `requirements.txt` for dependencies.

## Usage
- Use the scripts and notebooks to train and evaluate models.
- Place your data in the `data/` folder.
